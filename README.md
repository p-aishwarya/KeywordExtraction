# KeywordExtraction

The goal was to find an algorithm capable of extracting keywords in an efficient way, that always made sense alone, by themselves, even if out of context.
Basically used 3 alogorithms to extract the keywords from given sentences/corpus.
1. Rake
2. Yake
3. keyBert

NOTE - We can make changes in the given config file according the requirement.

Simply, using the python packages available in order to achieve the goal.

As a result, we are storing the keywords extracted using the above three libraires will be stored in a text file, and also added the common extacted keywords as a column in excel sheet, and respective to that added the scores of each keyword extracting method in order to compare them easily.

How to run -----------------------------
First set you virtual environment using the given keyword_extract.yaml file.
Then simple run the keyword_extraction.ipynb file to get the desired output.
