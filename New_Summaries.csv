Ecological Impacts,"Our planet is facing unprecedented environmental challenges, including climate change, water scarcity, degradation of ecosystems, and natural resources depletion.
Minimising our impact on the ecosystem We take responsibility and appropriate measures to address the most pressing environmental issues.
In 2019, this strategy was launched to address our environmental impacts from the beginning of our research process to cross-sector collaborations for improved planetary health.
This reduces the amount of transport needed to dispose of the concrete waste and deliver new materials, and conserves natural resources (ie,gravel), which has a direct positive impact on Roches ecological footprint.

Materials Sourcing and Efficiency,"Partnering with our towel supplier and the local municipality, we now send our towels back to the manufacturer where they are pulped and recycled into new paper products.
As the bins now contain exclusively paper towels, we can eliminate approximately 130,000 plastic bags from the site each year.
This includes our interactions to promote strong health, safety and environment (HSE) practices with suppliers who provide us materials for research and development, as well as with the contract manufacturers who help make our medicines and other pharmaceutical products.
Other optimisations were achieved by reducing the thickness and weight of thecardboard and paper for product information, increasing the useof recycled corrugated distribution components to100% and utilising packaging materials that are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.
By emphasising the environmental stewardship of our products, we address other material focus areas including responsible R&D, responsible supply chain, greenhouse gases, pharmaceuticals in the environment, water and waste.
We continue to reduce waste and increase material efficiency even as we provide more medicines to a growing number of patients.
As part of this program, in 2019, nearly three million pounds of plastic pallets and component trays were continually reused throughout the manufacturing process, and 2.6 million pounds of packaging material for incoming device components were sent to our recycling partner.","Before they enter the Lilly system, our raw material and component suppliers are evaluated for technical competence and the ability to provide high-quality, efficacious raw materials to Lilly. More information can be found in the Supply Chain section of this report. PMI is measured as kilograms of raw materials used to produce a kilogram of the final API.

Physical Impacts of Climate Change,"Some of the potential impacts of climate change to its business include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements, physical risks to the companys facilities, water limitations and disruptions to its supply chain.
Addressing this issue is a business imperative, as climate change is projected to have detrimental impacts on workforce health and productivity.3 An initial study from 2019 on climate physical risks to our activities, indicates the need for detailed site analysis to prepare for a smart adaptation to climate related hazards such as droughts, floods and extended hot periods.
Climate change generates risks as diverse as the impact of extreme weather events on our infrastructure and supply chain; scarcity of resources; carbon taxes, and their financial impact; and the direct or indirect repercussions for human health.
The direct effects of climate change include increased heat-related stress, floods, droughts, and extreme weather events such as hurricanes.
The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 13 million people die each year from environmentally related health risks, including 7 million people from air pollution alone.1 Air pollution can cause respiratory diseases;2 in fact, air pollution has been recognised as the second leading cause of non-communicable disease (NCD) deaths worldwide, behind tobacco smoke.3 The climate crisis poses risks to public health, with rising global temperatures now contributing to increased effects from respiratory and cardiovascular disease, impacts from extreme weather, food insecurity, changes in water-borne and vector-borne illnesses, increasing allergens, as well as mental health effects.","Some of the potential impacts of climate change to its business include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements, physical risks to the companys facilities, water limitations and disruptions to its supply chain.
